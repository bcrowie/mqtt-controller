### WIP

This project is based on the esp8266 development board. It utilizes an I2C SSD1306 128x64 OLED display, HW-040 (or KY-040) rotary encoder and a few buttons.

The device will connect to an MQTT broker, subscribe to and publish messages for specified devices. Wifi settings will be configurable via initial hotspot during setup.

The device can be used with all dev components connected via dupont jumpers, though wiring schematics with included list of electronic components will be provided, as well as STL files for 3D printing multiple variants of enclosures.
